Problem:
Given two words (start and end) and a dictionary, write a program to find the shortest transformation sequence from the start word to the end word, changing one letter at a time. Each transformed word must exist in the dictionary.

Requirements:

Use BFS to find the shortest path.
Implement a method to find all valid transformations (words differing by one letter) from each word.
Output the transformation path.
