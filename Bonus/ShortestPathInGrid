Given a grid of obstacles (1 represents an obstacle, 0 represents free space),
write a program to find the shortest path from the top-left corner to the
 bottom-right corner using BFS.

Requirements:

Implement BFS to traverse the grid.
Consider only valid moves (up, down, left, right) without going
 out of bounds or into obstacles.
Output the shortest path length or a message if no path exists.
