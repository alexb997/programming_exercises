Dynamic Accumulation with Conditional Modifications
Problem: You have a list List<Integer> nums that represents a sequence of values.
 Write a function that:
Modifies each element in the list by summing it with the sum of all previous elements,
 but only if it is even; if it is odd, subtract all previous elements.
Generates all unique permutations of this modified list and calculates
 a specific "weighted sum" for each permutation:
For each index i, multiply the element at index i by i+1 and sum up all the results.
Return the maximum weighted sum among all unique permutations.
Additional Requirements:
Avoid recalculating the sum if a permutation was already processed.
Ensure that the function has a time complexity of O(n!)
 for permutation generation but tries to minimize unnecessary calculations.
Hint: Consider how to track which permutations you've processed
 and think about how to handle permutations of lists with duplicate elements efficiently.
